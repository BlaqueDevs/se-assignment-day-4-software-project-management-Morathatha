ecommerce platform development
WATERFALL BENEFICIAL
construct of a building.
manufacturing process
EXAMPLES OF EACH
waterfall excels in projects with:
fixed, well defined requirements.
sequential dependencies.
strict compliance or documentation.
agile excels in projects with:
unclear or evolving requirements
high uncertainty
need for frequent feedback
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project:
1. Iterative testing
2. continuous integration
3. Code review & pair programming
4. Static code analysis
5. user acceptance trsting
6. PErfomance and security testing
Why maintaining high QA standards is critical
1. reduces costs
2. enhances user trust
3. compliance and security
4. reputation protection
5. supports scalability
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
defining the project scope establishes clear boundaries for what a project will deliver. It is foundational to successful planning because it:
1. Clarifies objectives.
2. Prevents scope creep.
3. Guides resource allocation.
4. Mitigates risks.
5. Serves as a reference.
WBS is a hierachial decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable components. It visualizes the entire scope in a tree-like format.
WHY IS IT USEFUL.
1. It simplifies complexity.
2. Improves accuracy.
3. Enhances accountability.
4. Supports tracking.
5. Facilitates tracking.

1. Visual timeline representation
2. Dependency mapping
3. Critical progress updates
4. real time progress updates
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
CORE ISSUES
1. Information overload and accessiblity
2. Process inefficiencies in a planning and execution
3. Skills gaps and expertise dependency
4. Decision making uncertainty
5. Communication and collaboration barriers.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem helps in multiple areas: requirements gathering, objective setting, stakeholder alignment, resource allocation, testing, user focus, risk management, feature prioritization.
